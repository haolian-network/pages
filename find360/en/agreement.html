    No matter what clause of this agreement is invalid or not enforceable for any reason, the remaining clauses are still valid and binding on both parties.

<p>
    Due to the rapid development of the Internet, the terms set out in this agreement signed by you and Find360 may not be fully listed and cover all your rights and obligations with Find360, and the existing agreements cannot guarantee full compliance with the needs of future development. Therefore, the plan inventory privacy policy and plan inventory platform code of conduct are supplementary agreements to this agreement, which are inseparable from this agreement and have the same legal effect. If you use the PLanToDo Platform Service, you are deemed to agree to the above supplemental agreement.
