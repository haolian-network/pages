    Due to the rapid development of the Internet, the terms set out in this agreement signed by you and the plan list may not be fully listed and cover all your rights and obligations with the plan list, and the existing agreements cannot guarantee full compliance with the needs of future development. Therefore, the plan inventory privacy policy and plan inventory platform code of conduct are supplementary agreements to this agreement, which are inseparable from this agreement and have the same legal effect. If you use the PLanToDo Platform Service, you are deemed to agree to the above supplemental agreement.
